# How to use Open Macro Input 

Open Macro Input is a software that make the bridge between the general functoinnality of Open Macro Input 
and what the native platform provide us.

It has some in Unity3D app tools with basic black box ready to be used.
And it has some third application connection that allows anyone to add himself to the tool.

I choosed Unity3D for this project because of two factor.

A. Unity3D is use on VR and XR devices and that the start point of the project:
Be able to communicate between the device and the computer to works in any environment.  

B. Unity3D is a multiplatform tool with the ability to use GPU with compute shader and CPU with JobSystem.
Making this tool runable almost everywhere with very good powerfull tool inside it.
