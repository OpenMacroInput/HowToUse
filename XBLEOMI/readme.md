# XInput by Raspberry Pi Pico OMI
  
By trying to simulate an XBox controller, I realize something important.  
You can connect you controller to a phone that will connect to the console by using online service.  
On Xbox and on Playstation.    
Meaning that if you can create a fake controller that is connected by BLE on your phone, you can QA test or DIY your input for you console.  
  
I have vague idea of how to create this code but this project is hight on ma list of project to code.  
The tutorial will be close to the XInput one as it will use the same way to write command.
