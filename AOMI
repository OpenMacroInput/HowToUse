# Android Open Macro Input

Is a third application on window that allows to communicate with ADB Wifi connection with your phone(s) in aim to do actions on it.
Most likely keystroke simulation and file transfert.

This part of the tool is not coding yet but I did experiment in the past on it and is just waiting to be code.
